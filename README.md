This folder contains all R files needed to run the Neighbourhood-based undersampling methods: NB-Basic, NB-Tomek, NB-Comm, NB-Rec.\
The main source file for an experiment with simulated datasets is "uniform_NBUnder.R". To change the undersampling method, uncomment line 5-8 as instructed in the file.\
The main source file for an experiment with UCI is "NBUnder_UCI.R". Uncomemment line 2-3 to choose the classifier. To change the undersampling method, uncomment line 5-8 as instructed in the file. The UCI datasets used in the paper are provided in the Zip file "Data_openML.zip".
